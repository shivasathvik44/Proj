<h2>Placement percentage</h2><p>🎯 Overall placement percentage:
The official site doesn’t publish a single overall %. External reviews vary widely (e.g., ~20% to ~60%), so there isn’t a reliable, audited figure to quote. If you need a clean number, you’ll have to aggregate department-wise selects vs. eligible strength from the institute directly.
